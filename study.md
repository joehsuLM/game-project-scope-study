# Game Project Scope Study

## Required Readings

-   [Game Project](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project)
-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)
-   [What is a User Story](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
    - See notebooks
-   The data structure you plan to use.
    ● user login: object
    ● user infomration: object
    ● gameboard: array
    ● move counter: number
    ● player 1 win status: boolean
    ● player 2 win status: boolean
    ● player 1 game piece: string
    ● player 2 game piece: string
    ● knowing which player's turn it is (need better wording): number
    ● game session: object?
    ● game state: string
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
-   How you plan to approach this project.
    ● Start with wireframes for high level organizaiton of the game
    ● Move to modeling based on user stories
    ● Entity modling
    ● Start with initial data structure -> this will change as the game is expanded/refined.
    ● Finalize game logic with basic/minimal UI -> once logic is finalized, plan on this can be moved to a stylized HTML UI.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
    1) As a player, I can login with a profile
    2) As a player, I can see my win/lose history
    3) As a player, I can restart the game after a match without reloading the page.
    4) As a player, I can place my game piece by clicking the spot of where it will be placed.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
    ● Ensure separation of HTML, CSS, JS
    ● Separate client-side and server-side logic
    ● Separate event handling
    ● Separate DOM manipulation
    ● Break down game components into appropriate functions - if necessary, into files.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
    ● Not possible for ties? If the game is heading to a tie, randomize a "bomb" game piece?
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
    ● Git commit early and commit often
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
    ● Add animation and styling flair

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
